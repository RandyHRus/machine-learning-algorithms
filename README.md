# Machine learning algorithms

These are some machine learning algorithms implemented for CPSC340 course at UBC.

The code was written by my teammate and I.

I have gained proficiency in implementing machine learning algorithms utilising Python and popular libraries such as Numpy and Pandas.

During this process, we focused on writing the algorithms from scratch, without relying on frameworks like Tensorflow or PyTorch.

Some algorithms implemented include k-means, k-nearest-neighbours, linear regression, logistic regression, naive Bayes, principal component analysis, stochastic gradient descent, and random forests.

## Notes

Some algorithms depend on proprietary course libraries which is not included here.
